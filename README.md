## Contributing

Thanks for your interest, but this repository is intentionally a personal project. I publish my solutions here as my own *Advent of Code* journey, not as a collaborative codebase.

If you want to participate in *Advent of Code*, create your own repository and enjoy working through the puzzles at your own pace. It’s much more fun and rewarding to solve the challenges yourself.
